    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h3>My name is Johann Ott. I live in Kildare, Ireland and work @ IBM.</h3>
    <p>
      I am a full stack developer with a passion for building large scale dynamic web applications with state of the art web technologies.
      I am always looking to keep abreast with changes in technologies and development processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I joined IBM 8 years ago after completing a B.Eng in Mechical Engineering and M.Sc in Software Development and Design at NUI, Galway.
      In my first year at IBM I worked as a Test Automation Enginner before moving into Front-End Development. More recently I have worked on all aspects of projects from front to back.

      In my spare time I like to play golf, follow national hunt racing and liverpool fc, mess around with the internet of things, build scale model aircraft and listen to electronic music.
