    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <h3>My name is Johann Ott. I live in Dublin, Ireland and work @ IBM.</h3>
    <p>
      I am a front-end web developer with a passion for building large scale dynamic web applications with state of the art web technologies.
      I am always looking to keep abreast with changes in technologies and development processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I joined IBM 5 years ago after completing a B.Eng in Mechical Engineering and M.Sc in Software Design and Development at NUI, Galway.
      In my first year at IBM I worked as a Test Automation Enginner before moving into Front-End Development.

    <p>
      In my spare time I like to play football and golf, watch every sport imaginable on TV, mess around with the internet of things, build scale model aircraft and listen to electronic music.
